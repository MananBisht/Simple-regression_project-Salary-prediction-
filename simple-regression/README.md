# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts employee salary based on years of experience
using a simple Linear Regression model.

## Concepts Used
- Regression
- Train/Test split
- MAE and RMSE
- Model visualization

## Results
The model predicts salaries with an average error of ~1000,
which is small relative to the salary range.

## Learnings
This project helped understand regression evaluation and
how error metrics differ from accuracy.
